        <h2>Current Research Areas</h2>
        <p> My current research interests are principally in the following areas:
<ul>
            <li> Mobile Sensing and Computing (IoT-based sensing, backscatter sensing)</li>
            <li> Context Recognition (Congestions in urban areas, human activities)</li>
            <li> Healthcare (Body core temperature estimation) </li>
</ul>
        </p>

<h4>Battery-less IoT</h4>
<p>The number of IoT devices is expected to be enormous, causing huge effort to maintain batteries. In this research, I realize cooperation among battery-less sensors by combining energy harvesting and ambient backscatter which connects sensors wirelessly with tiny energy consumption. The goal is to develop technologies for “Sustainable IoT platform”, which combines energy harvested at multiple devices to satisfy application requirements.</p>
<h4>Healthcare</h4>
We proposed a novel method to estimate core temperature based on a human thermal model considering individual differences. The method employs Gagge’s two-node model to simulate the change of core and skin temperature by calculating heat production in the body and heat exchange between the core node, the skin node, and the environment. In the warm-up, the proposed method determines the optimal parameter set representing individual thermoregulation function and physical feature through exhaustive simulation for comprehensive combinations of parameters. We also proposed various modifications for the original model in order to improve the estimation accuracy such as delaying thermal transfer and thermoregulation response. We have evaluated the proposed method through more than 120 hours of real experiments in running, walking, biking and tennis. The results show that the proposed method can successfully determine parameter sets which reduce estimation errors. The novel idea to estimate core body temperature by fusion of multimodal sensor data was very successful, leading to the collaboration with several companies and researchers in other fields. 

        <h4>Mobile Localization</h4>
              <p> We proposed a novel idea leveraging ad hoc communication among mobile devices to improve localization performance. In this work, we proposed an opportunistic ad-hoc localization algorithm called Urban Pedestrians Localization (UPL), for estimating locations of mobile nodes in urban districts. The design principles of UPL are twofold. First, UPL assumes that location landmarks are deployed sparsely due to deployment-cost constraints. Thus, most mobile nodes cannot expect to meet these location landmarks frequently. Each mobile node in UPL relies on location information received from its neighboring mobile nodes instead in order to estimate its area of presence in which the node is expected to exist. Although the area of presence of each mobile node becomes inexact as it moves, it can be used to reduce the areas of presence of the others. Second, UPL employs information about obstacles such as walls and presents an algorithm to calculate the movable areas of mobile nodes considering obstacles for predicting the area of presence of mobile nodes accurately under mobility. This also helps to reduce each node’s area of presence. The experimental results have shown that UPL could limit the positioning error to 0.7r on average by the above two key ideas, where r denotes the radio range.

                Also, we worked for mobile phone localization for firefighters. The localization method utilizes WiFi directional antennas placed around a target building. We also published several works related to localization in international conferences and journal papers for novel metrics considering relative positions, people density estimation, and GPS improvement.
